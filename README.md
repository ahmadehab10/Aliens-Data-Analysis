# Aliens-Data-Analysis
<h1>Project Summary</h1>
I Came across a fun dataset on kaggle about alien populations in USA and their characteristics which was perfect for me to explore using SQL to polish my skills,
I first explored the data by answering some questions in regard to the dataset, I then Created views for each question and exported them as csv files.
After importing the files in Power BI I began creating visualizations that would help me in creating a simple dashboard for anyone to get insights on the data easily
